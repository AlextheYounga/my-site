You come into his presense; you don't stand up and face him because you might attack, and he has reason to fear that you might because he's ruling you all. And the man who rules you all is the biggest crook in the bunch, because he's the one who's succeeded in crime. The other people are pushed aside, the criminals, the people we lock up in jail - are simply the people who didn't make it.  ",
